Axobot is not really a Gipsy instance, but it is maintained by the same original creator and both project share the same origin. It is designed to a ready-to-use high quality bot capable of handling a huge amount of servers, such as most popular bots like Mee6 or Dyno.

## üë∂ First steps

In a channel where the bot can read and write messages, follow the instructions below.

1. Define your language with the command `@gipsy config language <en|fr>`
2. Define the prefix with the command `@gipsy config prefix <prefix>`. 
   Exemple: type `@gipsy config prefix !` and then `!ping`

```{note}
In this documentation, we will use `@gipsy` as the prefix because it always work, even if another prefix is set.
```
3. Type `@gipsy config` to see the rest of the option you can configure. To edit a config option, enter `@gipsy config <option> <value>`
4. Type `@gipsy help` to see the list of commands.
5. Enjoy!

# Misc

## **Distribute Cookies**

You can distribute or request cookies via the command: `/cookie <Member>`. A villager will then take a cookie to the specified member. If you do not specify the member, the villager will give you the cookie.

## **Toss a coin**

Ever wanted to throw a coin but because you're poor you never had a coin on hand? We have solved this problem by adding the `/flipacoin` command which will flip a coin for you and tell you the result. Note that there is a non-zero chance that the coin will fall on its side, we have pushed the realism to the limit.

## **Hoster**

Enter the `hoster` command to get information about the bot's host.

## **Don't ask to ask, just ask.**

> It is often said that the best weapon is the one you don't have to use. I don't agree. In my opinion, the best weapon is the one you only have to use once." - Tony Stark

Are you tired of people asking if there are people to answer a question without saying what the question is? Well, so are we! After extensive research we have developed a formidable weapon in the form of a simple command that makes these people realize that it is better to ask a question directly than to make unnecessary detours that waste everyone's time. This command is `/dataja`, to be handled with the utmost care.

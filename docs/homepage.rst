🏃 Motivation
-------------

As Discord bot developers we noticed that there is a lot of different service bots, and a lot of tool to create your own bots, but nothing in between. We wanted to create a bot that would be easy to use and to configure, but also powerful and customizable.

This project has then 2 objectives:
- On the core side, the goal is to design a system that allow to simplify as much as possible the creation of plugins, and to make them as customizable as possible.
- On the plugin side, the goal is to create a lot of plugins that can be used by anyone, and that can be easily configured to fit the needs of the server.

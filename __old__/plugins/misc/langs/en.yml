      ***The timestamp in discord***

      *Example : Discord was created <t:1431468000:R>, the <t:1431468000:D>.*

      __**Use the timestamp feature**__ :
      You needs to get a UNIX timestamp (you can use the `timestamp get` and `timestamp create` commands), then you can use it with the following syntax:
      ```
      <t:[TIMESTAMP]>
      ```
      `[TIMESTAMP]` should be replaced with the timestamp you get.

      __**Utiliser les styles**__ :
      You can also style the timestamp using this syntax :
      ```
      <t:[TIMESTAMP]:[STYLE]>
      ```
      `[STYLE]` should be replaced by one of the following values:
      • `t` (<t:1431468000:t>)
      • `T` (<t:1431468000:T>)
      • `d` (<t:1431468000:d>)
      • `D` (<t:1431468000:D>)
      • `f` (<t:1431468000:f>, by default)
      • `F` (<t:1431468000:F>)
      • `R` (<t:1431468000:R>)

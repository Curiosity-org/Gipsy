# **Giveaways**

A giveaway system is available to offer gifts to your members when you feel like it. For this, you can use the command `/giveaway` or its short form `/gaw`. Many options for the giveaway are available, so we invite you to enter the command `/help gaw` to see the different options, and `/help gaw start` to understand how to start a fully customized giveaway. Once the giveaway is started, the bot will send a message with a reaction to the specified room. Members using the command to enter the giveaway or adding the reaction to the message will be added to the list of participants. At the end of the giveaway or when you use the `/gaw pick <gawName>` command, a member will be randomly selected from this list.

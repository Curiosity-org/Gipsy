            ***The timestamp in discord***
      
            *Example : Discord was created <t:1431468000:R>, the <t:1431468000:D>.*
      
            __**Use the timestamp feature**__ :
            You needs to get a UNIX timestamp (you can use the `timestamp get` and `timestamp create` commands), then you can use it with the following syntax:
            ```
            <t:[TIMESTAMP]>
            ```
            `[TIMESTAMP]` should be replaced with the timestamp you get.
      
            __**Utiliser les styles**__ :
            You can also style the timestamp using this syntax :
            ```
            <t:[TIMESTAMP]:[STYLE]>
            ```
            `[STYLE]` should be replaced by one of the following values:
            • `t` (<t:1431468000:t>)
            • `T` (<t:1431468000:T>)
            • `d` (<t:1431468000:d>)
            • `D` (<t:1431468000:D>)
            • `f` (<t:1431468000:f>, by default)
            • `F` (<t:1431468000:F>)
            • `R` (<t:1431468000:R>)

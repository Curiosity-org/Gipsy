# 💖 Thanks

At Gunivers, we believe that active members of a project should be rewarded for their efforts. We have therefore set up a reward system, allowing the server staff to congratulate certain people via a simple command: the `thanks` command.

After a certain number of thanks (1 at the moment, but later it will be possible to configure levels), the member receives a specific role that you will have configured. You are free to assign specific permissions.

In order for the system to reward only active members, and to encourage users to stay active, a thank you is only valid for a certain time: 30 days by default. It is also possible to configure this duration according to your choice, between one minute and .... hundred years if you like.

Three configuration options are available:

* `thanks_allowed_roles`: A list of roles allowed to use the `thanks` command
* `thanks_roles`: The roles given to thanked members
* `thanks_duration` : The duration of validity of a thank you

The `thankslist` command can be used to see the list of thanks given to a user, and `thanksreload` to refresh the roles.
